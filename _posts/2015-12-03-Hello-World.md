# Hello World!

This is the first post on my new blog so I figure I'd take this opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Patrick and I'm an electrical engineer and embedded software dev living in Savannah, GA. I'm a climber, backpacker, and space nut. I write articles and tutorials for [All About Circuits](www.allaboutcircuits.com/author/patrick-lloyd) and teach electronics and programming classes at [The Guild Hall](http://theguildhall.com/).
